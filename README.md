# My Pensieve Video Streaming Project

A reimplementation and extension of the Pensieve adaptive bitrate streaming system.

## Improvements Made

1. **Network Pattern Recognition**: Added adaptive rewards based on detected network patterns
2. **Buffer-Aware System**: Dynamic reward weights based on buffer state
3. **Performance Optimization**: Improved training efficiency

## Original Paper

Based on "Neural Adaptive Video Streaming with Pensieve" by Mao et al. (SIGCOMM '17).
